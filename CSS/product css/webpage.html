       <h4 class="first-h4">CATFISH</h4>
        <p>Catfish are a diverse group of ray-finnedfish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behaviorfrom the three largest species alive, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Europe,asia and the pirafba of South America.</p>
         

        <h4 class="first-h4">ECOLOGY</h4>
        <h5>Distributiom and Habitat</h5>
        <p>Extant catfish species live inland or in coastal waters of every continent except Antarctica. Catfish have inhabited all continents at one time or another. They are most diverse in tropical South America, Asia, and Africa, with one family native to North America and one family in Europe.</p>
         

        <h5>Species</h5>
        <p>European waters in the hope of obtaining a sporting and food resource, but the European stock of American catfishes has not achieved the dimensions of these fish in their native waters and have only increased the ecological pressure on native European fauna</p>
         

        <h4 class="top-h4">PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
        <h5>External Anatomy of Catfish</h5>
        <p>Most catfish are bottom feeders. In general, they are negatively buoyant, which means that they usually sink rather than float due to a reduced gas bladder and a heavy, bony head. [34] Catfish have a variety of body shapes, though most have a cylindrical body with a flattened ventrum to allow for benthic feeding</p>

     
        <h5>Internal Anatomy of Catfish</h5>
        <p>In many catfish, the "humeral process" is a bony process extending backward from the pectoral girdle immediately above the base of the pectoral fin. It lies beneath the skin, where its outline may be determined by dissecting the skin or probing with a needle.</p>
